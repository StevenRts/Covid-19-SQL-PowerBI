# Covid-19 Data Visualization
Using the World Health Organization Data set that I downloaded into Excel.

1. I imported the data set form EXCEL worksheet to Microsoft SQL and manipulated the data tables using SQL coding. \n
    See CovidPROJECT_SQL_DATA.sql above. 
    
2. The visualizations were created and sometimes played with before being imported into PowerBI
    
3. After importing the data sets into PowerBi the data was used to create PowerBI Dashboards. \n
    See POWER BI COVID DASH.pdf or download POWER BI COVID DASH.pbix to open it in PowerBI on your desktop.
